Totto sticks out his hand and challenges you to a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

Syntax: ROCKPAPERSCISSORS|RPS <adventurer> ROCK|PAPER|SCISSORS

Counting to three together, you and Totto simultaneously thrust out your hands, yours in the shape of a paper and Totto's in the shape of rock.
YOU WIN!
With the completion of your adventure, you feel your renown grow to new heights! (You gain 30 Renown.)

> Therefore, this is the best way to win at rock-paper-scissors: if you lose the first round, switch to the thing that beats the thing your opponent just played. If you win, don’t keep playing the same thing, but instead switch to the thing that would beat the thing that you just played. In other words, play the hand your losing opponent *just* played. To wit: you win a round with rock against someone else’s scissors. They are about to switch to paper. You should switch to scissors. Got it? Good.
